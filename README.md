# Final | WMM630 | Graduate School of Technology | Touro College
For the final project, you will finalize the brand creation you initiated for the midterm project, incorporating the feedback you received during the midterm. This will include updates to your logo, stationery, and web site mockups.

Additionally, you will also include a full résumé and two cover letters written to a human resources (HR) contact at two places where you’d like to work.

And finally, you will generate a style guide summarizing the designs of your web site and stationery.

## Résumé
If you presented a résumé during your midterm, then the class and I surely provided feedback. Incorporate that feedback into the version of your résumé that you’ll include in this project.

If you didn’t present a résumé during the midterm, create a new one or update your current one for inclusion in this final project presentation.

## Cover Letters
Go on Glassdoor and LinkedIn and research two positions that are a very good fit for your skillset and education. Write a letter to each of them and include those letters in this presentation.

## Style Guide
Add the following items to your style guide.

* Color palette
* Fonts
* Container sizes for desktop, tablet, and mobile web designs
* Grid column, gutter, and unit widths

## Compiling Your Presentation File
Compile all your assets into a *single* PDF called `presentation.pdf`. (Note the lowercase file name.) Before doing so, ensure that the size of each artboard/slide/image is as small as possible. **Your final presentation file, `presentation.pdf`, may not be larger than 25MB.**

Make sure to **exclude** working files, such as `.ai`, `.psd`, `.sketch`, or `.indd` files, from your submission.

## Due Date
Submit this project by no later than 6:15 PM on 16 May 2018. **No late work will be accepted.**
